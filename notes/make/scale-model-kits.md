# Scale Model Kits

## Equipment

- **Dual blade nippers vs Single blade snipper**
  - Dual blade is sufficient for most needs.
  - Single blade is not “better”. There’s a certain technique to using them. _You still need a dual blade nipper for finishing_.
- So far I found that airbrushing is not difficult to learn.
- I’m using a rather cheap airbrush. It has served me well so far.
- There are _USB-powered compressors_ nowadays. They are not very powerful, but I find them good enough for spray painting scale model kits.
- Get a bunch of “sticks with clips’. Blue tack or double-sided tape are also useful to hold the parts when painting and drying.
- For hand-painting of details, I discovered the “'Doloha” brand of acrylic/propene markers from China which I found to be pretty good. They are probably too wet for really fine details though. They have metallic colors too.
- Got some fluorescent DSPAIE markers which perform well too.

## Cutting

- It is better not to cut the parts flush but some distance away. Trim close and then sand.
- If you trim too much, a technique is to shave some material from the runners, dissolve in Mr Cement to make a putty you can paint on, and sand smooth after it dries. Or just buy some putty…

## Preparations for Painting

- **Wash** parts with soap. Although according to some it’s no longer a problem with modern kits. But the parts can also get oily from handling.
- Wearing **gloves** are recommended.
- Glue and remove **seam lines** as needed using Mr Cement or putty.
  - **Plan carefully** how you are going to paint & assemble the parts!
  - Don’t use too much cement. Fingerprints can transfer to the plastic, so wear gloves.
- Scribe **panel lines**. Use multiple light strokes to slowly deepen the grooves.
- **Light sanding** will help the primer stick better.

## Primer

- **Always prime before painting.**
- Some people say it’s not really necessary, but the purpose is not just to help the paint stick, but also to _provide a consistent surface for the paint_. Priming is recommended for metallic colours.
- Typically “lacquer” primers and paints are recommended. But “water-based” acrylics are less toxic.
- Nevertheless, wear a mask for protection.
- **Primers**
  - Model paint primer is just a pigment + binder formulated to bind well to plastic model surfaces and provide a smooth clean surface for the color coat to bond to. It is also used to identify problem areas as one performs surface prep. You would reprime after taking care of the problems found, possibly multiple times.
  - The Gunze (Mr Hobby) products are quite well regarded, and easy for beginners.
  - Mr Surfacer is a primer with extra ingredients formulated to fill in minor defects, the amount of fill is related to the number in the product title. It works similar to sandpaper grades.
    - **Mr. Surfacer 500** - Best for filling larger gaps and creating textures. Some people use with brush to feel gaps. Don’t airbrush.
    - **Mr. Surfacer 1000** (recommended) - A good middle ground for filling smaller imperfections and priming. It can cover sanding scratches
    - **Mr. Surfacer 1200 & 1500** - Ideal for a smooth primer coat, with 1500 being the thinnest and best for preserving surface detail.
    - **Mr Aqueous Surfacer 1000** is the aqueous version (using this now, seems good)
  - **Durability**
    - Mr Aqeuous Surface is softer than Mr Surfacer - can’t be scratched with fingernails, but can be scratched with tweezers. Instructions say can be brushed on.
    - Mr Surfacer is resistant to tweezers.
    - Both will lose against a scalpel blade.
    - Maybe more curing time will make it harder (few days)
  - The spray cans are supposed to be faster and convenient, but I think they will probably waste more paint.
- **Colors**
  - **Grey** - general use, but note that light colours may be darker on gray. Gray color is good for revealing any sanding defects.
  - **White** - for painting light colours
  - **Black** - for painting metallic. Never for light colours.
- _Paints for use on polysterene will destroy ABS_
- _Wait for primer to fully cure before painting_. There’s an effect known as “outgassing” which can wrinkle your paint layers. Dry to touch does not mean cured.

## Paint

- **Mr Color** is “lacquer”, **Mr Hobby Aqueous** is “acrylic”. But actually they are both acrylics.
- Mr Hobby Aqueous is technically not “water-based” due the thinner, but they are claimed to be less toxic and still behaves like “lacquers”.
- Some people atill prefer the lacquer paints for airbrushing because you can easily reactivate and remove them with lacquer. Acrylic paint can be a hassle to remove from airbrushes when dry.
- So far my experience with Mr Hobby Aqueous has been positive.
- Mr Color is not recommended for brush painting since it will feel more sticky because the paint is trying to dry quickly. Mr Hobby Aqueous can be use for brush painting (just need a few drops of thinner according to instructions)
- **Mr Hobby Acrysion**
  - Can thin with water, or use acrysion thinner
  - Comparable to vallejo, citadel, AK, army painter.
  - Good for brush painting. more difficult for spraying
- Ideal to wait a few days for the paint to fully cure, otherwise the next layer may activate the underlying one.
- General people recommend this layering:
  - Lacquer below Acrylics below Enamels
  - This is due to the solvents used for each type of paint. The upper layer won’t dissolve the layer below.

### Painting Gunpla inner frames

- Check first whether your inner frames have ABS.
  - As mention above, most hobby paints will break ABS (acetone dissolves ABS). True water-based acrylics should be ok.
  - If it’s PS then you can proceed.
- Painting frames may make things stick due to the extra layers. Check fit as you progress.

## Thinning Paints

### Thinners

- For the **Mr Hobby Aqueous** colors, the recommended ratio for airbrushing is **1:1 with Mr Hobby Aqueous Thinner**.
  - You can use Mr Color Thinner, but that’s a “lacquer” thinner, so kind of defeats the purpose of choosing the Aqeuous range (unless it’s for a specific color)
  - Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aELuy0_qtJI&ab_channel=BarbatosRex
- Mr Color Levelling Thinner has _retarder to slow the drying process_ (guess that’s why it is ‘levelling’)
- You can also use Tamiya X-20A (the A is for the acrylics)
  - _Water is usually not recommended_ although some people do that
  - IPA can be used, but need to be 91%
  - Some people say add 10% retarder to 91% alcohol and it ends up becoming something like levelling thinner.
- **Thinning ratios**
  - Depends on whether you are thinning for airbrush or hand painting. This is for airbrush.
  - **How much to thin**: rule of thumb is “consistency of "skim milk” for airbrush
  - **Mr Surfacer 1500** with Mr Levelling Thinner - thin at 1:1.5 (for air brushing)
    - Others say 2:1 ratio, some use 1:1
  - **Mr Hobby Aqueous Surfacer** - recommended to thin at 1:1
  - This should work with Tamiya also
  - **Brush painting**
    - Add a few drops of water will do?
    - Japanese seem to like using Magicclean, 1:1 ratio?. basically need to add Mr Retarder
    - Add drops with pipette. You don’t need a lot.

### Mixing Bottles

- It is recommended to use **mixing bottles**
  - Find good ones with screw on caps
  - HDPE (not LDPE), or PP
  - Translucent bottles are typically polyethene
  - Transparent bottle are PET
  - PET is ok for the acrylics, seems like everyone in Asia uses it anyway. But get the thicker ones.
  - Reference: https://www.curbellplastics.com/resource-library/material-selection-tools/chemical-resistance-of-plastics/
- **Thinning technique:**
  - Pre-thin using the _container itself as a measure_
  - Dump the paint into the mixing bottle.
  - Fill the container with thinner. Shake well, then dump into mixing bottle, and you’ve got your 1:1 ratio.
  - I found that you can still add a few more drops to get the residual paint. It doesn’t seem to affect the airbrushing result (with the Mr Aqueous paints).
  - This technique can get almost all the paint.
- Drop in a few “**mixing balls**” (stainless steel beads) as agitators.
- Label the bottle with the original labels

## Clear Coats

- Apply a clear coat (i.e. clear paint) **before applying decals**.
- **Clear coat must be glossy**, as decals need a smooth surface.
- Spray light coats (important) from some distance away, wait half an hour in between coats.
- **Thinning ratio**s:
  - Mr Color Clear Gloss C46 with Mr Levelling Thinner - 65:35
  - Aqueous: Clear Gloss H101

## Decals

- **Mr Setter** is used to glue the decal
  - _You may not need to use Mr Setter_. New kits usually have good decals.
  - It supposedly _hurts acrylics_, that’s why peple recommend to use lacquer for the base coat...but others have had no issues.
  - _Just use a drop_, wipe off in 10-15 secs.
  - Some people suggest to _dilute Mr Setter with 30% water first_, as current formula is stronger.
- Some people say can wipe off the residue with IPA (but don’t touch the decal itself)
- Some people say you don’t actually need Mr Softer (definitely don’t need for flat surfaces).

## Panel Lining

- **Tamiya accents** are enamels, however…
  - People also say Tamiya’s panel liners (enamel base) are ok on Mr Hobby Aqueous.
  - People say Tamiya’s panel liners can be cleaned up with lighter fluid, they supposedly won’t hurt the acrylic. But this is not quite true. petroleum based cleaners (for enamels) remove the plasticity of styrene, making them brittle and prone to cracking. so use sparingly.
  - Tamiya’s panel liners are known to _weaken polysterene_ actually. General wisdom is to apply their panel liners _before assembly_, because it can get into crevices and _slowly destroy the plastic_ as it cannot dry up.
- So perhaps it’s better to use **Mr Weathering**? (oil-based and doesn’t affect the plastic like Tamiya)
- **Make sure everything is cured first before panel lining**.

Not sure:

- Will top coat react with fluorescent markers?
- Does the Magiclean wash hack work for Mr Weathering? It has its own solvent for thinning.

## Top Coat

- **Mr Hobby Aqueous Premium Topcoat** is recommended but a little expensive. Cuts UV.
- **Do not use Mr Super Clear on acrylics** as it is lacquer and can melt acrylics.
- Matte looks nicer for Gunpla.
- https://www.mr-hobby.com/en/products/detail/36
- Testors lacquer is supposedly cheaper, but it depends on where you are.

## Markers

- Alternative to brush painting
- **Doloha** seems like a cheap and good brand
  - Comes in various sets including metallic colours. e.g. 72 colors, and 24 metallic colours
  - Basically liquid paint inside, has metallic ball
  - However, it flows too much for fine detail work
  - Slow to dry, metallic colour needs 1 full day
- **DSPAIE markers**
  - Supposed to be acrylics too
  - Its metallics look better than Doloha’s
  - Mr Hobby Top Coat works over them
- Don’t get Hobby Mio markers. Bad reviews.
- Don’t store markers with tip down as they may leak. Store horizontally.
- Markers nowadays are called “propene/propylene markers”. Solvent is propylene carbonate, which is a less toxic alternative to toluene and xylene, and marketed as safe for kids to use.
  - Propylene carbonate seems to be similar to but stronger than acetone.
  - So acetone probably can be used to remove. But since acetone can remove Mr Color as well, so basically can treat them as paint?

## Airbrush

- **Loading paint**
  - Never put the (unthinned) paint in first - always put in thinner first.
  - But it’s best to _thin the paint outside in a mixing bottle_, then transfer to the airbrush.
  - Good to put in a few drops of thinner before loading paint.
- **Painting technique:**
  - Adjust the air pressure:
    - Generally people recommend spraying at around 18-20 psi using a 0.3 needle, paint thinned at 1:1.
    - Valve near nozzle adjusts the air flow. Open up if splattering.
    - The knob at the back can be used to limit how far you can pull back.
  - Paint at a distance where you can just hear the paint hitting the surface (the sound will change)
  - **Double action airbrush technique**
    - Press down for air first, then slowly pull back for paint
    - Do not release suddenly. Slowly release the paint, before lifting your finger off.
    - This stops splattering the next time (due to residual paint near the nozzle)
- **Masking**
  - I find that normal masking tape works for rough jobs.
  - Main concern is the adhesive - you don’t want it too sticky.
  - Hobby masking tape can still be useful for detailed masking.

## Cleaning Airbrushes

- Clean the airbrush immediately after each use - dried paint is much harder to remove.
- Different paint types require different cleaning approaches.
  - For lacquer paints (e.g. Mr Color):
    - Use Mr Color Thinner or Mr Leveling Thinner for initial cleaning.
    - Run thinner through the airbrush until it sprays clear.
  - For water-based acrylics:
    - Use the appropriate thinner first (Aqueous Thinner for Mr Hobby Aqueous).
    - Follow with water for final rinse.
- Deep cleaning:
  - Disassemble the airbrush and clean each part individually.
  - Soak parts in appropriate cleaning solution (lacquer thinner for lacquers, etc.).
  - Use an airbrush cleaning brush to gently scrub needle and nozzle.
  - Ultrasonic cleaners are excellent for deep cleaning.
- Maintenance tips:
  - Apply a tiny drop of airbrush lubricant to the needle after thorough cleaning.
  - Never use harsh tools that might damage precision parts.
  - Check O-rings regularly and replace if damaged.
  - Never use lacquer thinner on parts with plastic O-rings as it can cause damage.
- Cleaning products to consider:
  - Mr Tool Cleaner - good for final cleaning of airbrush parts.
  - Alclad Airbrush Cleaner - works well for multiple paint types.
  - Iwata Airbrush Cleaner - gentle but effective.

### Quick Cleaning Steps

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RVPzj0YXi8&ab_channel=Harder%26Steenbeck
- Spray out the remaining contents into the pot
- Use No.4/6/8 brush (use larger brushes. Small brushes risk scratching the insides) from the “painty water” container to clean the cup, and wipe with paper towel
- Pour in some airbrush cleaner and spray.
  - Key step is to pulse the trigger.
  - If your airbrush can do the “bubble back” do it
- Check and repeat if necessary
- Do one last cycle to be sure (use a few drops)
- Use the paintbrush to clean the head
- Take out the needle and check if it’s clean

## Tips from a forum posting I found

> This is how I paint.
>
> - Prepare the surface so it's as smooth as possible prior to painting. Polishing pads help here.
>
> - Make sure there are no foreign substances on the model. I always wipe the model and all parts with 91% Isopropyl Alcohol () before painting. NEVER use hardware store lacquer (cellulose) thinner on plastic.
>
>   IPA
>
> - Thin the paint with the manuf's thinner unless an alternate has been _verified_ to work as well. For my preferred Mr Color, I use Mr Color Leveling Thinner (MLT). I use MLT for Colourcoat paints too, as I know it works well.
>
> - Thin to the consistency of 1% milk. I thin only the paint I'll need for the specific session. I don't put thinned paint back in the jar/tin.
>
> - Before adding paint to the airbrush cup, put 3 to 5 drops of paint thinner, NOT HW store lacquer (cellulose) thinner, into the airbrush cup. Start with just an airflow to ensure there's no fluid leakage past the needle. Then slightly pull back on the trigger so just a little fluid (thinner) is atomized. Make sure this starts smoothly and shows good atomization. Then go to full flow, again looking for good atomization. If any of this doesn't work, fix the problem with the airbrush and repeat until this step works. When this is done, you've ensured any fluid residue in the airbrush is fully compatible with your paint.
>
> - Resin and metal must be primed. Multiple surfaces, for example plastic and metal, should be primed. I always prime everything. I brush Mr Metal Primer on all metal surfaces and then thinned Mr Surfacer 1200 (thinned as above) over everything (including the already primed metal surfaces).
>
> - Set the full-flow air pressure to 15 PSI (1 atm). This means air (but not paint) is flowing through the airbrush. Static air pressure will be higher.
>
> - Spray at 0.25 in to 1.75 in (5 to 45 mm). This can be a little tricky to manage, but is very important to avoid those sandpaper-like surfaces. The most important part is to not get too far away, so the paint doesn't dry before it hits the model surface.
>
> - The paint should hit the surface slightly wet. Use a grazing light to see this. If the paint isn't wet when it hits the surface, you're going to get an orange peel, sandpaper, or worse.
>
> - Use thin coats to build coverage. White and yellow can require many thin coats to get full coverage. As I use lacquers, which dry very quickly, I can get full coverage in a single session. If I have multiple small parts I'll apply a thin coat to each part in turn until I've built full coverage on all parts. On a full model, I'll do the same with different parts of the model. I'm pretty sure this can be done this with Tamiya too.
>
> - If spraying a gloss color, only apply a final "wet" coat after full coverage. This is especially important for white and yellow.
>
> - Wait until the paint is fully dry before masking. For enamels, wait until the paint has cured (several days, until off-gassing can no longer be smelled). With Mr Color, I can mask in 30m to an hour if I'm trying to hurry.
>
> - I primarily use Tamiya masking tape because of its good adhesion and low tack. I will also mask with Frisket film when I need a more complicated mask. Microscale Industries Micro Mask works well for solvent paints. I always de-tack masking tape by laying it on the palm of my clean hand before applying to the model.
