# Reducing Cyclomatic Complexity

Cyclomatic complexity is a software metric that quantifies the complexity of a program's source code. In simple terms, it measures the number of linearly independent paths through your code. A higher cyclomatic complexity score indicates more complex code, which can be harder to understand, test, and maintain.

Think of your code as a roadmap. Cyclomatic complexity counts the number of different routes a driver could take to get from point A to point B. Each "if" statement, loop, or other decision point in your code creates a new potential path.

***

## Why Should You Care About Cyclomatic Complexity?

* **Code Maintainability:** The more complex your code, the harder it is for you or other developers to understand and modify it in the future without introducing new bugs. 😫

* **Testing Effort:** A higher complexity score means more possible execution paths, which in turn requires more test cases to ensure all scenarios are covered.

* **Bug Prevention:** Studies have shown a correlation between high cyclomatic complexity and a higher probability of defects. By keeping complexity low, you can reduce the likelihood of bugs. 🐞

* **Readability:** Code with lower complexity is generally easier to read and reason about, which is a big win for collaboration and code reviews.

A good rule of thumb is to aim for a cyclomatic complexity of **10 or less** for any given function or method.

## How to Reduce Cyclomatic Complexity

### 1. Break Down Large Functions

One of the most effective ways to reduce complexity is to break down large, complex functions into smaller, more focused ones. Each smaller function should have a single, well-defined responsibility. This is often referred to as the **Single Responsibility Principle**.

**Before:** A single large function that handles user input validation, data processing, and database updates.

**After:** Three separate functions: one for validation, one for processing, and one for database interaction.

### 2. Simplify Conditional Logic

Complex conditional statements with many `if-else if-else` blocks can significantly increase cyclomatic complexity. Look for opportunities to simplify this logic.

* **Use Polymorphism:** In object-oriented programming, you can often replace complex conditional logic with polymorphism. Instead of a large `switch` statement that checks an object's type, you can have different subclasses that each implement the same method in their own way.

* **Use Guard Clauses:** A guard clause is a conditional at the beginning of a function that returns early if a certain condition is met. This can help to reduce nesting and make the main logic of the function clearer.

* **Simplify Boolean Expressions:** Sometimes, complex boolean expressions can be simplified using logical rules like De Morgan's laws.

### 3. Remove Duplicate Code

Duplicate code not only increases the amount of code you have to maintain but can also contribute to higher cyclomatic complexity. If you find yourself writing the same or very similar code in multiple places, extract that code into its own function and call it from the different locations.

### 4. Leverage Libraries and Frameworks

Don't reinvent the wheel! Before you write complex logic from scratch, check if there's an existing library or framework that can handle it for you. These tools often provide well-tested and optimized solutions that can significantly reduce the complexity of your own code.

Here are some practical code examples in JavaScript and Java showing how to reduce high cyclomatic complexity.

***

## 1. Using Guard Clauses to Reduce Nesting

One of the most common sources of complexity is deeply nested `if` statements. You can simplify this by using **guard clauses**, which are checks at the beginning of a function to handle edge cases and exit early.

### JavaScript Example

Before: High Complexity (Nested if statements)

This code nests checks, making the main logic hard to find.

JavaScript

```javascript
function processPayment(user, amount) {
    if (user) {
        if (user.isLoggedIn) {
            if (amount > 0) {
                // Core logic is buried deep inside
                console.log(`Processing payment of $${amount} for ${user.name}`);
                return true;
            } else {
                console.error("Payment amount must be positive.");
                return false;
            }
        } else {
            console.error("User is not logged in.");
            return false;
        }
    } else {
        console.error("No user provided.");
        return false;
    }
}
```

After: Low Complexity (Using Guard Clauses)

This version flattens the logic by handling invalid conditions first and returning immediately. The "happy path" is clear and un-nested.

JavaScript

```javascript
function processPayment(user, amount) {
    // Guard clauses handle errors at the top
    if (!user) {
        console.error("No user provided.");
        return false;
    }

    if (!user.isLoggedIn) {
        console.error("User is not logged in.");
        return false;
    }

    if (amount <= 0) {
        console.error("Payment amount must be positive.");
        return false;
    }

    // Core logic is now easy to read
    console.log(`Processing payment of $${amount} for ${user.name}`);
    return true;
}
```

## 2. Breaking Down Large Functions

A single function trying to do too many things will naturally have more decision points. Breaking it into smaller, focused functions is a powerful refactoring technique.

### Java Example

Before: High Complexity (One large method)

This single method handles validation, calculating different prices, and applying discounts.

Java

```java
public class OrderProcessor {
    public double calculateTotal(String userType, int quantity, double price, boolean hasCoupon) {
        double total;

        if ("MEMBER".equals(userType)) {
            total = quantity * price * 0.9; // 10% member discount
        } else if ("VIP".equals(userType)) {
            total = quantity * price * 0.8; // 20% VIP discount
        } else {
            total = quantity * price; // Standard price
        }

        if (hasCoupon && total > 50) {
            total -= 5.0; // Apply $5 coupon on orders over $50
        }

        return total;
    }
}
```

After: Low Complexity (Smaller, focused methods)

The logic is now separated into distinct responsibilities, making each part simpler.

Java

```java
public class OrderProcessor {
    public double calculateTotal(String userType, int quantity, double price, boolean hasCoupon) {
        double baseTotal = calculateBaseTotal(userType, quantity, price);
        double finalTotal = applyCoupon(baseTotal, hasCoupon);
        return finalTotal;
    }

    // Responsibility 1: Calculate price based on user type
    private double calculateBaseTotal(String userType, int quantity, double price) {
        if ("MEMBER".equals(userType)) {
            return quantity * price * 0.9;
        }
        if ("VIP".equals(userType)) {
            return quantity * price * 0.8;
        }
        return quantity * price;
    }

    // Responsibility 2: Apply coupon discount
    private double applyCoupon(double total, boolean hasCoupon) {
        if (hasCoupon && total > 50) {
            return total - 5.0;
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```

## 3. Replacing Conditionals with Polymorphism or Strategy Pattern

In object-oriented programming, a complex `switch` statement or a long `if-else if` chain based on an object's type is a classic sign of high complexity. Polymorphism can eliminate this entirely.

### Java Example

Before: High Complexity (Using a switch statement)

This code has to check the animalType and change its behavior accordingly. Adding a new animal requires modifying this switch statement.

Java

```java
public class Animal {
    private String animalType;
    // constructor...

    public String makeSound() {
        switch (animalType) {
            case "dog":
                return "Woof";
            case "cat":
                return "Meow";
            case "cow":
                return "Moo";
            default:
                return "Some animal sound";
        }
    }
}
```

After: Low Complexity (Using Polymorphism)

We create separate classes for each animal type. The logic for making a sound is encapsulated within each class. Adding a new animal just means adding a new class, with no changes to existing code. This follows the Open/Closed Principle.

Java

```java
// Abstract base class or interface
public abstract class Animal {
    public abstract String makeSound();
}

// Concrete implementations
public class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public String makeSound() {
        return "Woof";
    }
}

public class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    public String makeSound() {
        return "Meow";
    }
}

public class Cow extends Animal {
    @Override
    public String makeSound() {
        return "Moo";
    }
}

// Usage: The calling code doesn't need any conditional logic.
// Animal myDog = new Dog();
// System.out.println(myDog.makeSound()); // Prints "Woof"
```

## IDE Extensions and Plugins

* **VS Code**: Extensions like **CodeMetrics** or **SonarLint** are excellent choices. CodeMetrics, for instance, calculates the complexity of each function and displays it right above the function definition. You can set thresholds to highlight functions that exceed a specific complexity number (e.g., 10).

* **JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, WebStorm, PyCharm)**: These IDEs have built-in code analysis tools that can be configured to warn you about high complexity. You can find this under `Editor > Inspections > Method Metrics`. The **CodeMR** plugin also provides detailed visualizations of code complexity.

* **Visual Studio**: The built-in **Code Analysis** feature (and the "Code Metrics" tool) can calculate cyclomatic complexity for your .NET projects. You can run it on-demand or as part of your build process.

***

## Linters and Static Analysis Tools

* **ESLint (for JavaScript/TypeScript)**: You can configure ESLint with a rule to check for complexity. The `complexity` rule allows you to set a maximum acceptable value.

  JSON

  ```json
  // In your .eslintrc.json file
  "rules": {
    "complexity": ["error", 10] // Throws an error for functions with complexity > 10
  }
  ```

* **PMD (for Java, and other languages)**: PMD is a popular static analysis tool that includes a ruleset called "design" which contains the `CyclomaticComplexity` rule. You can configure it to flag methods that exceed a certain threshold.

* **Pylint (for Python)**: Pylint checks for many code quality issues by default, including complexity. It will report on functions that it deems "too complex."

***

## Standalone Code Quality Platforms

* **SonarQube**: This is an open-source platform for continuous inspection of code quality. It performs automatic reviews with static analysis of code to detect bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities, including cyclomatic complexity. It provides a detailed dashboard to track complexity over time.

* **Codacy**: Similar to SonarQube, Codacy automatically analyzes your repositories and provides reports on code quality, including flagging complex methods. It integrates directly with Git providers like GitHub and GitLab.
