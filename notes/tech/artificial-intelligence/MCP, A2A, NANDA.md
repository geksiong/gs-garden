# MCP, A2A, NANDA

## **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**

- Gives agents a universal way to interface with tools, APIs, and data sources.
- Embeds context with each call, making agent actions more reliable and explainable.
- Empowers specialists: agents use the right external resource for the task at hand — instantly.

## **A2A (Agent-to-Agent)**

- Standardizes messaging, negotiation, and coordination between AI agents — even from different vendors or clouds.
- Enables _modular workflows_: agents connect, delegate, and adapt in real-time, sidestepping brittle, one-off integrations.

## **NANDA (Networked Agents & Decentralized AI)**

- Provides decentralized directories, public discovery, and verifiable identity for agents.
- Enables robust reputation and governance — agents find and trust each other automatically, across organizational boundaries.
- Supports market-like negotiation, consensus, and distributed policy enforcement — unlocking scale and resilience.

## **Practical Scenario**

A retail company launches a new flash sale.

- The pricing agent finds the supply agent via NANDA.
- They chat through A2A, agree on a restock schedule, and both ping the analytics agent (via MCP) for the latest trends.
- The whole process is automated, governed, and traceable — with zero fragile integrations.
