# Guqin music on the Guitar?

Lately I've grown to like the sounds of ancient Chinese _guqin_ (古琴) music, and as both a classical guitar player _and_ an _erhu_ (二胡) player, I've been wondering whether it might be possible for _guqin_ music to be transcribed to the modern guitar.

## Not a new idea

Some quick Googling reveals that I'm not the only guitarist to have entertained the idea. General consensus is that even if it were possible to play _guqin_ music on the guitar, more will be lost rather than added by using the guitar. Ancient _guqin_ music is quite different from modern "Chinese-style" songs, or even "classical" Chinese pieces. The latter is actually easier to arrange for on the guitar. You can't actually "arrange" ancient _guqin_ music...

## Guqin Tuning

The _guqin_ has seven strings tuned to `C D F G A c d` (lowest pitch to highest pitch), basically the pentatonic scale.

The "natural" key of the _guqin_, I suppose, is the key of F major (3rd string starting from lowest pitched string) or `1=F` using Chinese _jianpu_ notation. _Guqin_ strings are numbered from the lowest pitched string, i.e. reverse that of the guitar. But that doesn't affect our discussion here.

## Initial Explorations - Possible Compatible Guitar Tunings

The immediate observation is that the guitar is tuned mostly in fourths, making the _guqin_'s major second jumps an obvious chhallenge. We can "cheat" by re-stringing the guitar using the closest compatible gauges (`E E G G G d`) and down-tuning them to match the _guqin_ (that's still short of one string unless you have a 7-string guitar). But I want to try to find a solution by adjusting from the standard guitar tuning.

Some possible solutions I've came up with so far are:

- `D G d ? ? ?` corresponding to _guqin_ strings 1, 3, 6, transposed to `1=G`
- `E A c# f# ? ?` corresponding to _guqin_ strings 1, 3, 5, 7, transposed to `1=A`
- `? G c g a ?` corresponding to _guqin_ strings 1, 3, 6, 7, transposed to `1=C`
- `? G c e a ?` corresponding to _guqin_ strings 1, 3, 5, 7, transposed to `1=C`
- `? A c g a ?` corresponding to _guqin_ strings 2, 3, 6, 7, transposed to `1=C`
- `? A c e a ?` corresponding to _guqin_ strings 2, 3, 5, 7, transposed to `1=C`
- `? A d g a ?` corresponding to _guqin_ strings 2, 4, 6, 7, transposed to `1=C`
- `? A d e a ?` corresponding to _guqin_ strings 2, 4, 5, 7, transposed to `1=C`
- `? A d f# a ?` corresponding to _guqin_ strings 1, 3, 5, 6, transposed to `1=D`

The main problem I see is that we can only squeeze the _guqin_'s 7 open strings, into a maximum of 4 on the guitar.

The last candidate is quite interesting in that it matches the `D A d f# a d'` which is a not uncommon tuning on the guitar.

## Other Challenges

_Guqin_ music uses a lot of natural (and artificial) harmonics. Most likely these effects will be lost on the guitar.

There are also a lot of glides which are critical to the _guqin_'s feel, and which might be impossible to solve for depending on the guitar tuning selected.

## Any Successful Examples?

I'm working on something and will publish it if I'm successful.
