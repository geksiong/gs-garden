# MacroPad Configuration

Macropad: CXT-12E4
Configuration: uses a custom VIA-C firmware and app

_Update 2025-10-12: it appears to support QMK now, should I switch?_

## Layers

Bottom row: Fn 1 to 4

- 0: default
  - dial: vol +/- (press to toggle mute)
  - dial: zoom in/out (Mac) (press to reset zoom)
  - dial: up/down
- 1: alternative control
  - dial: zoom in/out (Win)
  - dial: pgup/pgdn
- 2: graphics editor?
  - tool quick select (do in software?)
  - rotate
- 3: audio editor?
  - cursor left/right
- 4: window management
  - snap left/right/corners
  - full screen / maximise
  - switch work spaces
  - increase window size?
- 5: keyboard control layer
  - hold Fn 1 and 4 to enter
  - dial: backlight effects (press to toggle backlight)
  - dial: change layer (press to reset to default layer)

Too bad there's no double tap ability in the custom VIA-C firmware.
